The DragonFly framework for building ISO image (nrelease)
=========================================================

Important user-tunable variables
--------------------------------

ISODIR			default prefix of ISOFILE and ISOROOT
ISOFILE			name of the ISO image to generate
ISOROOT			location where to fresh world is installed to
KERNCONF		kernel configuration to use

PKGSRC_PACKAGES		default list of packages to be added to the ISO
PKGSRC_PKG_ADD		location of pkgsrc-style pkg_add used during build
PKGSRC_PKG_PATH		location of binary packages to be added to the ISO
PKGSRC_BOOTSTRAP_FILE	location of the bootstrap kit
			(this must be local, PKGSRC_PKG_PATH can be remote)
PKGSRC_DB		db location used by the bootstrap kit
PKGSRC_PREFIX		localbase used by the bootstrap kit
PKGSRC_RSYNC_SRC	where to fetch packages from during make fetch

WITH_INSTALLER		if defined, the BSD installer is added to the target

The default values match the packages from packages.stura.uni-rostock.de.


Important targets
-----------------

fetch			fetches the bootstrap kit and binary packages using rsync
release			builds world and kernel, installs them, adds packages and
			prepares the ISO image
quickrel		same as release, but use quickworld and quickkernel
realquickrel		same as release, but skips buildworld and buildkernel


First time usage
----------------

The nrelease framework expects to find a working pkg_add from pkgsrc.
You can use the bootstrap kit, which matches the default configuration,
or install it yourself.  If you use a location other than /usr/pkg, you
have to specify PKGSRC_PKG_ADD in make.conf.

If you want to have any packages install in the ISO (the default), run
``make fetch'' first, to get them and the bootstrap kit used in the ISO.
By default, the current directory is used, the location can and should
be overriden by PKGSRC_PKG_PATH in make.conf.
